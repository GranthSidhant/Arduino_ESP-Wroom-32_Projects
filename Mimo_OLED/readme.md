# Talking to Mimo â€“ ESP32 Emotion Display Project

This project lets users interact with an animated character named **Mimo** hosted on an ESP32. When powered on, the ESP32 creates a Wi-Fi Access Point that users can connect to. After joining the network, users can open a webpage and type a message. The message is analyzed and an emotion is displayed on a connected OLED screen in the form of a simple animated face representing that emotion.

## ðŸ“¡ Network Setup

In your Arduino code, the Wi-Fi name (SSID) and password are set as:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "Mimo-Network";
const char* password = "mimo1234";

After connecting to the wifi network, Wi-Fi Access Point (URL/ IP address) will print on serial monitor of IDE.
Enter that URL address in any browser to access web page for user interaction
